# Learn-HTML---Full-Tutorial-For-Beginners

This repository contains all the files that I have made during the tutorial 'Learn HTML - Full Tutorial For Beginners' from www.freecodecamp.org hosted on Youtube. It includes the files arranged lesson wise having code mostly in HTML and a bit of CSS, too. It also includes one project in lesson 10. The resources used in the tutorial have also been mentioned in the 'Resources' folder.
